🎬 IMDB Top Movies Analysis (1946–2014): A Data Story in Ratings and Time


This dashboard explores what truly defines a timeless movie by analyzing 25 of the highest-rated films on IMDb between 1946 and 2014. With an impressive average IMDb rating of 8.81, the dataset reflects only elite, critically acclaimed productions.
One striking insight is the relationship between movie duration and audience appreciation. Films lasting around 3 hours to 3 hours 30 minutes consistently achieved ratings close to 9.0, suggesting that audiences reward well-paced, in-depth storytelling rather than short runtime.
Content rating analysis shows that Restricted (17+) movies dominate the list (14 out of 25), indicating that mature, complex narratives often resonate more strongly with critics and viewers. In contrast, family-oriented and general-audience movies appear less frequently among the top-rated titles.
At the peak of excellence sits “The Shawshank Redemption” with a rating of 9.3, reinforcing its reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Other classics like The Lord of the Rings series and The Matrix also confirm the lasting power of epic storytelling.


📌 Key Insight:
Great movies are not defined by age, genre, or length — but by depth, narrative quality, and emotional impact.


🚀 Recommendation:
Future filmmakers and studios should invest in strong scripts, complex characters, and fearless storytelling, as data shows these qualities consistently drive higher audience ratings.
